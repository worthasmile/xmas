        Worth a smile and Christmas cards
      </h1>
      <p class="mb-4">
        For years, I've loved creating and sending handmade Christmas cards and
        tiny gifts to the people closest to me. Every December, that simple act
        of drafing, painting, writing, and mailing something real has brought me
        a kind of joy that digital messages never could. This season, I wanted
        to take that feeling a little further - to share it with more people,
        and to remind us all of the magic of receiving something handwritten.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Worth a Smile is my small, passion-driven initiative built on one
        belief: the tiniest, most thoughtful gestures often carry the greatest
        meaning. While the long-term vision for Worth a Smile includes crafting
        unique handmade gifts and custom hampers, the heart of this brand is
        much simpler - to spread a little everyday happiness.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        For this very first complimentary project, I chose the vintage Indian
        yellow postcard. Many of us remember seeing them as kids, maybe even
        receiving one - the excitement of finding it in the mailbox, the sense
        of connection it carried. That memory stayed with me, and I wanted to
        bring a piece of it back. So I decided to hand-paint each postcard,
        hoping to recreate that warm, nostalgic feeling.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        I don't know when each card will reach its destination, or if all of
        them will - but that's part of the charm. This isn't a perfect, polished
        project. It's human. It's heartfelt. It's a small attempt to revive the
        joy of simple, meaningful gestures.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Because sometimes, the smallest things - a brushstroke, a stamp, a few
        kind words - are all it takes to make life <span class="text-red-700"
